This project is based on vector semantics to test the accuracy of Mikolov's analogy dataset. 

'Pretrained' word embeddings are word embeddings that are already constructed in advance. In this project the following 
two pretrained vector embeddings are used:
1) Word2Vec
2) GLOVE (Global vectors for word representation)

ProjectDesc contains the tasks being implemented and other details about the three tasks.

Report file contains all the required explanation to the project.
